# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the UTM Move project as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Updated package.json with the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the resolved dependencies

### 2. Modified Files

#### src/App.jsx
- **Added import**: Imported the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
- **Added Analytics component**: Integrated the `<Analytics />` component in all three render paths:
  1. Loading state - Added Analytics component to the loading screen
  2. Mobile view - Added Analytics component to the mobile app render
  3. Desktop view - Added Analytics component to the main desktop layout

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the Vercel Web Analytics guidelines for React applications (similar to create-react-app). The Analytics component was strategically placed in all return paths to ensure tracking works across all user experiences:

- In the loading state (while app initializes)
- In the mobile responsive view (for small screens)
- In the desktop view (for larger screens)

Each Analytics component is placed at the end of its respective render tree, wrapped in a React Fragment (`<>`) where needed to maintain proper JSX structure.

## Testing & Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter ran with no new warnings or errors (only pre-existing warnings)
✅ All files properly staged with git

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
2. Deploy the application
3. Verify tracking by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in the browser's Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard

## Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and visitor data
- Route support is included with the React implementation
- No additional configuration is required - analytics will activate once deployed to Vercel and enabled in the dashboard
